# punk-narrative-soundtrack
This project explores **emotional arcs and narrative structures** in cult and coming-of-age films with punk, anarchist, or nihilist elements â€” using their **soundtracks** as the emotional proxy.

I scrape soundtrack data from IMDb, extract track-level features using genre mappings, and analyze emotional progressions using time series and clustering techniques.
